Ingredients:
	1 brick of 1/3 cream cheese
	Miracle Whip
	Milk
	Pre-cut Chives

Step 1:
	Add the cream cheese to a medium sized
	bowl, and begin adding the miracle whip
	and milk. There is no measurement, just
	add them to a point where the creamcheese
	is easy to mix up and loses its sturdiness,
	and then continue to mix until desired texture
	is aquirred.

Step 2:
	Add the chives to the mixture. No measurement
	here either, just enough to make them well present
	throughout the entire dip. Mix until dip is
	homogeneous.

Step 3:
	Enjoy :)
